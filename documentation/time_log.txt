Our estimation was as follows:

29.5 hours total
12.5 hrs for learning python/pygame (2.5 hrs/person)
3 hrs for design
15 hours coding (3 hrs/person)
4 hours putting code together and hashing out bugs

Explanation:
I, Jake, made the estimation near the start of the project because I had the
experience in pygame that led us to choose the language. I chose it because I
was confident in a tutorial that would help everyone get up to speed quickly
and then we could use python in a way that would create a nice user interface
(compared to the command line). The tutorial was about 2 hours long, plus time
for setting up the proper python installations. I estimated 3 hours for design
as I figured this was about as long as I guessed that it would take me to do it.
I made the estimates for the length it would take to code as I guessed this was
as long as I thought it would take me. I accounted for 4 hours to put the code
together because I assumed that with different people coding there would be
some issues with the code working succinctly.

Review of the estimation:
I did not account for the time meeting with the team, or for time working on
the documentation of the code(whether it be during the coding or afterwards). I
also did not account for the unfamiliarity of all members of the team on GitHub
which led to added time to get the code to work together. The estimation for
coding time was also ambitious because assuming that the teammates could code
their parts in the same time as I could after just learning Python( three members
had not seen the language before)
